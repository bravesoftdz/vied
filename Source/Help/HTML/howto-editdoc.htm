    <h1>
      <em>How do I</em> ... Edit a document
    </h1>
    <p>
      You must first choose the document you wish to edit. This can either be
      a <a
        href="howto-newdoc.htm"
      >new document</a> or you can open an existing document either by using the
      <span class="menuref">File | Open</span> menu option or by dragging the
      file from Windows Explorer and dropping it on the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are four different aspects of the document that can be edited
    </p>
    <h2>
      Version information
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is the most important aspect of the document and is displayed in the
      main window, which is divided into three distinct parts, each under its
      own heading which is described below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Version information items under each heading can be edited individually
      either double clicking the item or selecting it and choosing the
      <span class="menuref">Edit | Current Item</span> menu option or pressing
      <span class="smallcaps">F2</span>. A dialogue box suitable for editing the 
      selected item is displayed.<br><a
        href="howto-edititem.htm"
      >Learn more</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>
      FIXED FILE INFO
    </h3>
    <p class="indent">
      The fixed file info items are numeric items, flags or bitmasks that define
      the file and product version numbers, the target operating system, the
      application type and some optional flags that provide further information
      about the build.
    </p>
    <h3>
      TRANSLATION INFO
    </h3>
    <p class="indent">
      This section contains information about the language and character set
      used in the executable file.
    </p>
    <h3>
      STRING INFO
    </h3>
    <p class="indent">
      This section contains string file information. There are 12 predefined
      entries each of which is labelled in the display. Each can take up to 128 
      characters of text.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      The editor supports special <a 
        href="whatis-fields.htm"
      >fields</a> that can be inserted into string info items to enable the
      text to be automatically updated with the value of the field. This is the
      most powerful feature of the Version Information Editor and greatly eases
      the updating of version information resources.<br><a
        href="howto-fields.htm"
      >Learn how to use fields</a>.
    </p>  
    <h3>
      Limitations
    </h3>
    <p>
      Although the version information specification allows for more than one 
      translation and a separate string file information section to be 
      associated with each translation this program supports only one
      translation and one string file information section.
    </p>
    <p>
      Custom string file information entries are also permitted but not
      supported by the program.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Identifier
    </h2>
    <p>
      Although not strictly required, an <a
        href="whatis-identifier.htm"
      >identifier</a> for the version information
      resource can be specified.<br><a
        href="howto-editid.htm"
      >Learn more</a>.
    <h2>
      Version Information File Comments
    </h2>
    <p>
      <a
        href="howto-commentvi.htm"
      >Comments can be specified</a> that are added to the top of saved <a
        href="whatis-vifile.htm"
      >version information files</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Resource file comments
    </h2>
    <p>
      <a
        href="howto-commentrc.htm"
      >Comments can be specified</a> for inclusion in generated <a
        href="whatis-resfile.htm"
      >resource source files</a>.
