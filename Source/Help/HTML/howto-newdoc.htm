      <em>How do I</em> ... Create a new document
    </h1>
    <p>
      A new document is automatically opened when the program first starts. To
      discard an existing document and begin a new one simply select the
      <span class="menuref">File | New</span> menu option then <a
        href="howto-editdoc.htm"
      >edit the document</a> as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new document takes default values from any <a
        href="whatis-preferences.htm"
      >preferences</a> have been saved. If there are no preferences then system
      default values are used.
    </p>      
    <p>
      If the existing document has unsaved changes when
      <span class="menuref">File | New</span> is selected a dialog box appears
      that gives the option of saving the changes, loosing the changes or
      cancelling the creation of the new document.
