      <em>How do I</em> ... Register a resource compiler
    </h1>
    <p>
      In order to export binary <a
        href="whatis-resfile.htm"
      >resource files</a> an external resource file compiler must be registered
      with the program. This is done by selecting the
      <span class="menuref">Options | Resource compiler</span> menu option and
      providing the required information in the resulting <a
        href="dlg-rescompiler.htm"
      >Specify Resource Compiler<a> dialogue box.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Version Information Editor starts up and there is no registered
      resource compiler the program automatically displays a dialogue box
      seeking this information. The display of this dialogue box can be switched
      off by ticking a check box.
