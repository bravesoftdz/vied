      <em>What is</em> ... An Identifier
    </h1>
    <p>
      A <a
        href="whatis-vistatement.htm"
      >VERSIONINFO resource statement</a> begins with a resource identifier
      which must have value 1. However, this value may be stored in a symbolic
      identifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The user may specify an identifier to use for this purpose by choosing the 
      <span class="menuref">Edit | RC Identifier</span> menu option. The current 
      <a 
        href="whatis-preferences.htm"
      >preferences</a> store the default identifier (if any).
    </p>
    <p>
      If an identifier is specified it has to be defined to have value 1 in the
      <a
        href="whatis-resfile.htm"
      >resource file</a>. The editor creates a suitable definition if an
      identifier is specified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maximum length of the identifier is 31 characters must be made up of
      letters, digits and underscores and may not begin with a digit.
    </p>
