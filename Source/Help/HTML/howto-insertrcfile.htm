      <em>How do I</em> ... Insert code into an existing resource source file
    </h1>
    <p>
      Sometimes you may prefer to insert or update a <a
        href="whatis-vistatement.htm"
      >version information statement</a> in an existing <a
        href="whatis-resfile.htm"
      >resource source file</a> rather than create a resource file containing
      only the version information statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Version Information Editor offers no direct way to do this, but does
      provide some help to make the process easy. Here's what to do:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Copy the current document to the clipboard using the
        <span class="menuref">Edit | Copy</span> menu option. The documents is
        converted into a <a
          href="whatis-vistatement.htm"
        >version information statement</a> and placed on the clipboard in plain
        text format.
      </li>
      <li>
        Open the resource source file in a text editor. Find the location to
        insert the version information and delete any existing statement.
        <span class="warning">*</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        Paste the version information statement the Editor placed on the
        clipboard into the resource file.
      </li>
      <li>
        Save the resource file.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <span class="warning">*</span> Only one version information statement is 
      permitted in a resource file so it is important that any existing
      statement is deleted.
    </p>
