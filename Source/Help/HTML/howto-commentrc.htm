      <em>How do I</em> ... Include comments in a resource file
    </h1>
    <p>
      Comments can be included in an exported <a
        href="whatis-resfile.htm"
      >resource source file</a> by using the <span class="menuref">Edit | RC
      Comments</span> menu option which displays the <a
        href="dlg-comments.htm"
      >Comments Editor</a> dialogue box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter multi-line comments as required. Do not enter the special
      <code>/*</code> and and <code>*/</code> comment delimiters as these will
      be added automatically. Be sure not to use the delimiters within the
      comment text as this is an error that will not be detected by the Comments
      Editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that RC comments are recorded with <a
        href="whatis-preferences.htm"
      >preferences</a> so use this facility to record any standard comments.
