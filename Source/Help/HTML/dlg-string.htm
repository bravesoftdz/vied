    <h1>
      String Information Editor
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box appears when you edit any STRING INFO item for which
      editing is currently permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The current value of the string is displayed in a multi-line edit box at
      the top of the dialogue box. The string can be edited as desired.
      <strong>Note:</strong> Pressing return doesn't enter a new line of text
      but may close the dialog box. This is because STRING INFO text must be on
      one logical line.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a
        href="whatis-fields.htm"
      >Fields</a> can be entered in the text as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the cursor where the field is to be entered in the text.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select the required field from the <em>Insert Field</em> drop-down list.
        This list contains all valid fields for the STRING INFO item being
        edited.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the <em>Insert</em> button.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Fields can also be entered by typing them directly into the text,
      enclosing the name by angle brackets. To enter &lt; character in the text
      it must be entered as &lt;&lt;&gt;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click <em>OK</em> to accept your changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> When <em>OK</em> is clicked the entry is validated.
      If an unknown field is encountered an error message is displayed.
      Dismissing the error message returns you to the dialogue box with the
      erroneous field highlighted ready for correction. If <a
        href="whatis-autovalidation.htm"
      >automatic validation</a> is switched on and no text has been entered
      for a required STRING INFO item then a warning is displayed with the
      option of ignoring the warning or returning to the dialogue box to enter
      some text.
    </p>
