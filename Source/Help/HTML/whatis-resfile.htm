      <em>What is</em> ... A Resource File
    </h1>
  </body>
  <p>
    A resource file is a file containing the definition of various Windows
    resources to be used by an application, DLL or certain other Windows files.
    Such resources include:
  </p>
  <ul class="unspaced">
    <li>
      String Tables
    </li>
    <li>
      Bitmaps
    </li>
    <li>
      Icons
    </li>
    <li>
      Cursors
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Of course resource files can also include version information. Version
    information in resource files is contained in a <a
      href="whatis-vistatement.htm"
    >VERSIONINFO statement</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Resource files are usually created as resource source (.rc) files and
    compiled into binary (.res) files by a resource compiler. These binary files
    are finally linked into applications by a linker.
  </p>
  <p>
    This program can <a
      href="howto-creatercfile.htm"
    >create resource source files</a> that contain a single VERSIONINFO
    statement but no other resources. It can also copy a VERSIONINFO statement
    to the clipboard for <a
      href="howto-insertrcfile.htm"
    >insertion</a> into an existing resource file.
  </p>
  <p>
    If an external resource compiler is available Version Information Editor can
    use it to create a binary resource file containing just the version 
    information. <a
      href="howto-rescompiler.htm"
    >More information</a>.
