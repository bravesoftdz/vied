      Version Number Editor
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box appears when you edit either of the File Version # or
      Product Version # FILE INFO items.
    </p>
    <p>
      Version numbers are in four parts. The current value for each part is
      displayed in an edit box and the first value is highlighted. Edit the four
      parts of the version number as required then press <em>OK</em> to accept
      your changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is only possible to enter the digits 0-9 in the edit boxes since
      version numbers must be numeric. A blank entry is read as zero.
