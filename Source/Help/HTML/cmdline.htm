    <h1>
      Command Line Options
    </h1>
    <p>
      This topic describes the options available when Version Information Editor
      is started from the command line.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Window-less (&quot;silent&quot;) operation
    </h2>
    <p>
      The program can export a <a
        href="whatis-resfile.htm"
      >resource source (.rc) file</a> from a native <a
        href="whatis-vifile.htm"
      >version information (.vi)  file</a> without displaying a window. This
      option is provided to enable the program to be used in automated build
      systems and make files.
    </p>
    <p>
      The required command line is:
    </p>
    <pre class="indent">vied -makerc vifilename [rcfilename]</pre>
    <p>
      <code>-makerc</code> must be the first parameter and the name of the .vi
      file to be processed must be the second parameter. Put this name in quotes
      if it contains spaces. The third (optional) parameter is the name of the
      .rc file to be generated, again in quotes if necessary. If the third
      parameter is not provided the generated .rc will have the same name as the 
      .vi file, but with the extension changed to .rc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the file has been generated, or if there is an error the program
      terminates. The program retrurns one of the following exit codes:
    </p>
    <ul class="unspaced">
      <li>
        0 &ndash; the program completed successfully.
      </li>
      <li>
        1 &ndash; error: the input file does not exist.
      </li>
      <li>
        2 &ndash; error: there was a problem loading the .vi file.
      </li>
      <li>
        3 &ndash; error: there was a problem converting and/or writing the .rc file.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Default file paths
    </h2>
    <p>
      If a directory path is passed as the only parameter on the command line
      this is used as the default directory for all the program’s file dialog
      boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The default directory may be overridden by the program if another path
      would make more sense.
    </p>
