      <em>What is</em> ... A VERSIONINFO statement
    </h1>
    <p>
      This is an important concept because the sole purpose of this program is
      to make it easy to create and update VERSIONINFO resource statements.
    </p>
    <p>
      A VERSIONINFO statement defines a resource within a resource file that
      provides information about an executable file's version along with 
      additional related information.
    </p>
    <p>
      In brief, a VERSIONINFO statement can contain the following information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        File and product version numbers, both as binary values and as strings.
      </li>
      <li>
        The target operating system.
      </li>
      <li>
        The type of file (e.g. application, DLL, device driver, font etc. and,
        for some file types, a sub-type.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flags indicating whether the executable is a debug release, pre-release,
        a special build etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        The target language.
      </li>
      <li>
        The character set used by the executable.
      </li>
      <li>
        A set of predefined string values stored as name / value pairs for such
        uses as general comments, file descriptions, name of company, copyright, 
        name of product etc.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      VERSIONINFO statements can have more than one language or character set,
      with different string information for each language / character set. They
      can also have additional string values with user-defined names. However
      these features are not supported by Version Information Editor at present.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERSIONINFO statements always have a resource type of VERSIONINFO and a
      resource id of 1.
