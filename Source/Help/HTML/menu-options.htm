          Toggles between two methods of displaying File Flags and File Flags
          Mask information. When the menu option is ticked the information is
          displayed in full, i.e. all the file flags in a bit set are identified
          by name. When the option is off just the hexadecimal values are
          displayed. In either case the full description is used when editing
          these items. The default state of this option can be specified by
          using the <span class="menuref">Options | User Setup</span> menu
          option.
