      This dialogue box appears when one of the FIXED FILE INFO items:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        File OS
      </li>
      <li>
        File Type
      </li>
      <li>
        File Sub-Type (when File Type = VFT_DRV or VFT_FONT)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      or one of the TRANSLATION INFO items:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Language
      </li>
      <li>
        Character Set
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      are selected and you choose the <span class="menuref">Edit | Current
      Item</span> menu option (or you double click one of the items).
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialogue box displays a drop-down pick list of all the valid symbolic
      constants (for FIXED FILE INFO items) or descriptions (for TRANSLATION
      INFO items) for the chosen item. You should select the desired value and
      click <em>OK</em> to accept your choice.
