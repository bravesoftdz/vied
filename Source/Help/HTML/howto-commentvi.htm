      <em>How do I</em> ... Comment my version information document
    </h1>
    <p>
      You can specify comments that will be included in saved <a
        href="whatis-vifile.htm"
      >version information files</a> by using the <span class="menuref">Edit |
      VI Comments</span> menu option which displays the <a
        href="dlg-comments.htm"
      >Comments Editor</a> dialogue box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter multi-line comments as required. The <code>;</code> character is
      used to mark comment lines. Do not enter this yourself at the start of a
      line as it is added automatically. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that VI comments are recorded with <a
        href="whatis-preferences.htm"
      >preferences</a> so use this facility to record any standard comments.
      The program defines a standard set of VI Comments that is uses by default.
      To remove them delete them in the Comments Editor then <a
        href="howto-preferences.htm"
      >save your preferences</a>.
