      Open File Dialog Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This standard Windows dialogue box appears when the user chooses the
      <span class="menuref">File | Open</span> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      It allows the user to choose a <a
        href="whatis-vifile.htm"
      >version information file</a> to open for editing. Only files with 
      the .vi extension are displayed. If any other extension is used an error 
      message appears and the operation is cancelled. The chosen file must
      exist.
