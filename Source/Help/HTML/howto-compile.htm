      <em>How do I</em> ... Compile a binary resource file
    </h1>
    <p>
      The current document can be compiled to a binary <a
        href="whatis-resfile.htm"
      >resource file</a> by choosing the <span class="menuref">File |
      Compile</span> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a default output folder for the compiler has been specified for this 
      document, and the document has been saved, the output file has the same
      name as the document and is stored in the designated folder. Otherwise a 
      dialog box is displayed where the name of the .res file can be entered. To 
      specify a default output folder use the <span class="menuref">Edit |
      Compiler Output Folder</span> menu option. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> A resource compiler must have been <a
        href="howto-rescompiler.htm"
      >registered</a> with this program before this facility can be used.
