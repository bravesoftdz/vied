    <h1>
      Specify Resource Compiler Dialogue Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box is used to register a resource compiler with Version
      Information Editor. The program uses the registered compiler when
      creating binary resource files. The following information is required:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Path to resource compiler:</em> The full path to the resource compiler
      to be used should be entered in this edit box. To select the path using a
      standard Windows dialog box click the button adjacent to the edit box.
      This displays the <a
        href="dlg-browserescomp.htm"
      >Browse for Resource Compiler</a> dialog box from which the required
      program file can be chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Command line to use to compile a source file:</em> The command line to
      pass to the resource compiler should be entered here. Two place holders
      should be included in the command line: &lt;SRC&gt; and &lt;BIN&gt. These
      placeholders are replaced with the name of the source file to be compiled
      and the name of the output executable file respectively. The program
      recognises the Borland Resource Compiler (BRCC32) and will suggest an
      appropriate command line if BRCC32 is entered in the <em>Path to resource
      compiler</em> edit box. For other compilers the required command line may
      be found from the compiler’s documentation. <strong>Note:</strong> It may
      be necessary to enclose the &lt;SRC&gt; and &lt;BIN&gt; place holders in
      double quotes.
    </p>

      Click <em>OK</em> to accept the changes.

    <h2>
      Start-up checks
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Version Information Editor first starts it checks to see if a
      resource compiler is present and displays a similar dialog box if not.
      This dialog box can be used as above to configure the compiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      To prevent the dialog box from appearing on each start-up you can check
      the <em>Don't perform this check again</em> check box that appears only in
      this special version of the dialog box.
