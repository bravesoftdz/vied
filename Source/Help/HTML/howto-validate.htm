      <em>How do I</em> ... Validate version information as it is entered
    </h1>
    <p>
      Version information is validated as you enter it if the program's <a
        href="whatis-autovalidation.htm"
      >automatic validation</a> option is switched on. This is done by toggling
      the <span class="menuref">Options | Automatic Validation</span> menu
      option so that the menu item is checked.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you prefer this option to always be switched on use the <a
        href="dlg-setup.htm"
      >User Setup</a> dialogue box (accessed from the
      <span class="menuref">Options | User Setup</span> menu option) and tick
      the <em>Automatic validation</em> check box. This has an effect the next
      time the program is started.
