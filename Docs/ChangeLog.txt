Release v2.11.2 of 16 June 2008
+ Changed to make application minimisation, task bar preview window, and appearance in "Flip 3D" task switching display correctly on Windows Vista. This required an update to DelphiDabbler About Box Component v3.4.
+ Provided work-around for Delphi's Alt key bug on XP and Vista (CodeGear Quality Central bug report #374030).

Release v2.11.1 of 30 April 2008

+ Changed to use user's application data folder for preferences instead of program installation folder.
+ Changed text of some dialog boxes.
+ Prevented program from writing test files to check if a drive is available. This code fails in protected folders on Vista.

+ Made some string literals localisable.
+ Some refactoring and unit renaming.
+ Changed installer to display license and to permit installation on Vista.

Release v2.11 of 20 March 2005

Release v2.10.1 of 4 December 2003

Release v2.10 of 18 November 2003
+ Added new facility to directly compile a .vi file to a predetermined output folder, details of which are stored in the .vi file, providing that an external compiler is configured. This was done by:
  - adding a new File | Compile menu option with hot key F9;
  - adding a new Edit | Compile Output Folder menu option to enable compiler output folder to be edited.
+ The help file was updated to cover the new features.
